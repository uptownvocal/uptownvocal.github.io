      <h2>Ian Bowe</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Ian Bowe</span> is the latest member of the Uptown Vocal California contingent, hailing from Irvine California where he likes to remind us he gets to spend his Christmases on the beach. He loves digging into a dense philosophy book, eating Oreos, and discussing the Platonic nature of Avatar: The Last Airbender. We like to tease Ian for his slight commitment issues, having joined 5 different a cappella groups during his first semester at Columbia. Amazingly he manages to juggle all those rehearsals expertly and is always filling our sound with his beautiful booming base tone.</p>

      <h2>Jackie Brown - Music Director</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Jackie Brown</span> brings the spunk to the soprano section. Hailing from Scarsdale, NY, she is one of the sassiest members skilled in deflecting satire with her own witty sarcasm. When she’s not gracing us with her superb sop tones, she’s stage managing at the Shakespearian level in Columbia’s own KCST or stepping into the spotlight in campus musical productions. But while she steals the stage everywhere she goes, she is also sweet and sincere and always ready for a snuggle.</p>

      <h2>Nicolas Duran</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Nicolas Duran</span> is simply THE BEST!! Always bringing the energy, the spunk, the funk, and the style to match, Nic manages to put a smile on everyone's face just being in the same room as them.  Nic has somehow developed the closest thing to speaking with emojis known to man thus far, and he is always down to help out fellow UVers expand their vocab to sound ~hip and cool.~  Thank goodness we have this ball of energy lifting everyone's spirits.  Don't forget us when you're famous, Nic!</p>

      <h2>Karinya Ghiara - President</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Karinya Ghiara</span> has an exceptionally strong yet sweet alto tone to match her refreshingly kind and upbeat personality. Originally from San Diego, Karinya arrived in New York City with a smile on her face and excitement in her eyes. Her cheery attitude brings much appreciated humor and energy to Uptown Vocal. In addition to her vivacity and vocal skill, Karinya loves theatre and is a fabulous actress. It may seem like Karinya could not wipe the smile off her face if she tried, but don’t be fooled- when she slips into whatever character she is playing, you might not even recognize her! Karinya was born to perform and is an incredible asset to Uptown Vocal. Most importantly, Karinya really loves a good grilled cheese.</p>

      <h2>Morgan Grant</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Morgan Grant</span> brings us her sunny personality and bright smile all the way from Dix Hills, Long Island! She joined us in the fall of 2018 and she’s been gracing the soprano section with her smokey tone and infectious laugh ever since. Whether she’s eating croissants at Hungarian, practicing ASL, or meditating, Morgan is spunky as hell and sweet as can be.</p>

      <h2>Sydney Fox</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Sydney Fox</span> hails from Ashburn Virginia, and brings her bright soprano timbre and fun attitude to the UV family. Her wild driving skills may make us nervous, but she never fails to entertain with a great story and a can of yerba matte. Although she loves jazz, Sydney can rock a country song (and cowboy boots) any day of the week. Sydney is a foxy fashionista, and we are so grateful to have her!</p>

      <h2>Sophia Lacambra - Buiness Manager</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Sophia Lacambra</span> may only be a few inches over five feet, but she brings the energy to the alto section with her luscious, smooth voice.  Sophia hails from across the country in Washington State and when she's not with us, you might find her in Paris, Maine, Ireland, Hawaii, or anywhere else that involves travel. Sophia loves a quality grilled cheese and is always down for Diana dinner or JJ's.  We love Sophia almost as much as she loves dogs. Or running. Or running after dogs.</p>

      <h2>Rafael Lippert</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Rafael Lippert</span> certainly knows how to bring the drama to any Uptown Vocal arrangement. Whether he’s gracing us with his rich tenor tones or adding some Mean Girls inspired moves to a Christmas arrangement he always keeps the audience (and his fellow singers!) engaged. Rafael comes to us all the way from Porto Alegre Brazil, and when he’s not having secret mid-rehersal Portuguese chats with Marina he can be found buried in a neuroscience textbook or petting/stealing the nearest dog. </p>

      <h2>Tatum McConnell - Treasurer & Publicity</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Tatum McConnell's </span> love of all things jazz is evident both in her spotify listening history and her dedication to Uptown Vocal.  The alto section would not be complete without her, and we are so lucky to sing with this lovely lady!  While she is far from her Pacific Northwest home here at Columbia, we can't imagine the group (or getting through sectionals) without her.</p>

      <h2>Brent Morden</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Brent Morden</span> is the next great American composer. Hailing from beautiful Bayside, Queens, this musical mastermind keeps UV in key with his perfect pitch and his smooth bass voice. Brent's talents expand far beyond a cappella: he also performs in the Columbia Wind Ensemble and writes music for groups of all shapes and sizes. He's the only Uptown Vocalian with a bird, and he'll soon be leading the house band on the Eric Andre Show.</p>

      <h2>Lance Morden</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Lance Morden </span> became part of the UV fam in the fall of 2018 and has brought his incredible musicality and drive to Uptown Vocal ever since! His steady rhythm in the bass section is certain to keep us on track through even the most treacherous harmonies, key changes, and syncopations. Lance joins us from Bayside Queens and can often be found running in New York City’s various parks in impressively color coordinated outfits. With his warm smile and charming personality he always knows how to brighten anyone’s mood. </p>

      <h2>Reuben Rahmeyer</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Reuben Rahmeyer </span> has been gracing us with his mellifluous tenor tones since the spring of 2018. Studying applied physics in SEAS, Reuben’s artistic streak pairs perfectly with his analytical mind. If you hear the mysterious sounds of a jazz standard drifting through the halls of Havemeyer or down Riverside Drive, chances are it’s Reuben since he’s literally. always. singing. Reuben, we’re so happy to have your lovely voice with us, and we promise we won’t let you get any more accidental concussions on retreat! </p>

      <h2>Jayne Reel</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Jayne Reel's</span> sultry and deep mezzo tone perfectly matches her personality: unique, interesting, and you always want to hear more. Hailing from the show choir capital of Connecticut, you can usually find her studying something psychology or statistics related or watching Criminal Minds. She is always down for a milk shake or grilled cheese at Toms, and even though the sopranos want to steal her, she will always be a beloved member of the alto section.</p>

      <h2>Robert Willard</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Robert Willard</span> joined us in spring of 2019, and is very proud to hail from “the historic capital of New York”, Albany. When asked to explain further Robert stated: “French Indian War? They’re trying to capture Albany. American Revolution? Trying to capture Albany. And it’s the start of the Erie Canal!” (We’re sure he could go on but frankly, we’re afraid to ask.) Robert is majoring in economics and slavic studies and we’re all incredibly inspired by his charitable work in Uzbekistan as president of the Aral Sea World Charity. Robert’s perfect bass notes enrich the group’s sound from the first very first chord to the last sustained harmonies and we’re so glad to have him! </p>
