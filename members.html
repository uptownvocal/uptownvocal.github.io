      <h2>Ian Bowe</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Ian Bowe</span> is the latest member of the Uptown Vocal California contingent, hailing from Irvine California where he likes to remind us he gets to spend his Christmases on the beach. He loves digging into a dense philosophy book, eating Oreos, and discussing the Platonic nature of Avatar: The Last Airbender. We like to tease Ian for his slight commitment issues, having joined 5 different a cappella groups during his first semester at Columbia. Amazingly he manages to juggle all those rehearsals expertly and is always filling our sound with his beautiful booming base tone.</p>

      <h2>Nicolas Duran - Business Manager</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Nicolas Duran</span> is simply THE BEST!! Always bringing the energy, the spunk, the funk, and the style to match, Nic manages to put a smile on everyone's face just being in the same room as them.  Nic has somehow developed the closest thing to speaking with emojis known to man thus far, and he is always down to help out fellow UVers expand their vocab to sound ~hip and cool.~  Thank goodness we have this ball of energy lifting everyone's spirits.  Don't forget us when you're famous, Nic!</p>

      <h2>Sydney Fox</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Sydney Fox</span> hails from Ashburn Virginia, and brings her bright soprano timbre and fun attitude to the UV family. Her wild driving skills may make us nervous, but she never fails to entertain with a great story and a can of yerba matte. Although she loves jazz, Sydney can rock a country song (and cowboy boots) any day of the week. Sydney is a foxy fashionista, and we are so grateful to have her!</p>

      <h2>Sophia Lacambra</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Sophia Lacambra</span> may only be a few inches over five feet, but she brings the energy to the alto section with her luscious, smooth voice.  Sophia hails from across the country in Washington State and when she's not with us, you might find her in Paris, Maine, Ireland, Hawaii, or anywhere else that involves travel. Sophia loves a quality grilled cheese and is always down for Diana dinner or JJ's.  We love Sophia almost as much as she loves dogs. Or running. Or running after dogs.</p>

      <h2>Tatum McConnell - Music Director</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Tatum McConnell's </span> love of all things jazz is evident both in her spotify listening history and her dedication to Uptown Vocal.  The alto section would not be complete without her, and we are so lucky to sing with this lovely lady!  While she is far from her Pacific Northwest home here at Columbia, we can't imagine the group (or getting through sectionals) without her.</p>

      <h2>Lance Morden - Music Director</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Lance Morden </span> became part of the UV fam in the fall of 2018 and has brought his incredible musicality and drive to Uptown Vocal ever since! His steady rhythm in the bass section is certain to keep us on track through even the most treacherous harmonies, key changes, and syncopations. Lance joins us from Bayside Queens and can often be found running in New York City’s various parks in impressively color coordinated outfits. With his warm smile and charming personality he always knows how to brighten anyone’s mood. </p>

      <h2>Reuben Rahmeyer - Treasurer</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Reuben Rahmeyer </span> has been gracing us with his mellifluous tenor tones since the spring of 2018. Studying applied physics in SEAS, Reuben’s artistic streak pairs perfectly with his analytical mind. If you hear the mysterious sounds of a jazz standard drifting through the halls of Havemeyer or down Riverside Drive, chances are it’s Reuben since he’s literally. always. singing. Reuben, we’re so happy to have your lovely voice with us, and we promise we won’t let you get any more accidental concussions on retreat! </p>

      <h2>Jayne Reel - President</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Jayne Reel's</span> sultry and deep mezzo tone perfectly matches her personality: unique, interesting, and you always want to hear more. Hailing from the show choir capital of Connecticut, you can usually find her studying something psychology or statistics related or watching Criminal Minds. She is always down for a milk shake or grilled cheese at Toms, and even though the sopranos want to steal her, she will always be a beloved member of the alto section.</p>

      <h2>Samantha Seiff</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Samantha Seiff</span>joined us in the Fall of 2019 and we feel so lucky to have her beautiful smoky-sweet tone in the alto section. She’s a true triple threat, dancing, acting, and, most importantly, singing with incredible talent and grace. Her bold personality is met perfectly with her warm heartedness. She brings positivity and laughs to every rehearsal and we’re so happy to have her! </p>

      <h2>Robert Willard</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Robert Willard</span> joined us in spring of 2019, and is very proud to hail from “the historic capital of New York”, Albany. When asked to explain further Robert stated: “French Indian War? They’re trying to capture Albany. American Revolution? Trying to capture Albany. And it’s the start of the Erie Canal!” (We’re sure he could go on but frankly, we’re afraid to ask.) Robert is majoring in economics and slavic studies and we’re all incredibly inspired by his charitable work in Uzbekistan as president of the Aral Sea World Charity. Robert’s perfect bass notes enrich the group’s sound from the first very first chord to the last sustained harmonies and we’re so glad to have him! </p>
